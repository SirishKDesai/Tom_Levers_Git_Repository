    Use t().

How do I include multiple dates, with custom names (e.g., create, update), in an Rmd file header?
    For a start, in Rmd file header: date: 'Updated `r format(Sys.Date(), "%B %d, %Y")`'

How do I automatically wrap code and output?
    For a start, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73577848/wrapping-a-line-without-spaces-in-r-markdown-output/73578702?noredirect=1#comment129932748_73578702

    For a start, see bookdown.

Statistics

Why is the number of bins of a histogram calculated as the square root of the number of data?

    This is actually not a statistics question. I believe its a warning message that gets printed out by the function. Not sure the motivation behind it. 
    Another way to specify the bins or binwidth to get rid of the warning message could be 
    ggplot(Data,aes(x=Age))+
        geom_histogram(binwidth = 1,fill="blue",color="orange")
    I tend to like a binwidth of 1.

    See https://github.com/tslever/Tom_Levers_Git_Repository/blob/main/Classify_Oak_Leaves/Classify_Oak_Leaves.py, a program that classifies images as     containing an oak leaf or not using a one-neuron neural network. This program was based off of https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-    learning?specialization=deep-learning. In this program, I calculated the initial weights as a vector of random numbers drawn from the standard normal     distribution, scaled by 1 / sqrt(n). Is the number of bins and this scaling factor related?


Architecture

What naming conventions do you use for R objects?

    What naming conventions do you use for R objects, including packages, directories, files, functions, and variables? The tidyverse style guide     (https://style.tidyverse.org/files.html) does not describe package names. The Google style guide     (https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs109l/unrestricted/resources/google-style.html) is based off of the tidyverse style guide.

    Whatever makes sense to you yourself. As stated in the first link "I think the best rule of thumb is that if you can give a file a concise name that       still evokes its contents, youâ€™ve arrived at a good organisation. But getting to that point is hard."
    It might take some experience to figure out what works best for you.

    What have been the style expectations of large teams with which you have worked?

How do you create classes in R in the Python / Java / C++ sense?
